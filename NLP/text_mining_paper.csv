2,"Recognizing textual entailment is a fundamental task in a variety of text
mining or natural language processing applications. This paper proposes a
simple neural model for RTE problem. It first matches each word in the
hypothesis with its most-similar word in the premise, producing an augmented
representation of the hypothesis conditioned on the premise as a sequence of
word pairs. The LSTM model is then used to model this augmented sequence, and
the final output from the LSTM is fed into a softmax layer to make the
prediction. Besides the base model, in order to enhance its performance, we
also proposed three techniques: the integration of multiple word-embedding
library, bi-way integration, and ensemble based on model averaging.
Experimental results on the SNLI dataset have shown that the three techniques
are effective in boosting the predicative accuracy and that our method

decision. While recent research has proposed various technical approaches to
provide some clues as to how a learning model makes individual decisions, they
cannot provide users with ability to inspect a learning model as a complete

Bayesian regression mixture model with multiple elastic nets. Using the
enhanced mixture model, we extract explanations for a target model through
global approximation. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we evaluate
it on different learning models covering the tasks of text mining and image

5,"Given the growing number of new publications appearing everyday, literature
reviews are important for software engineering researches to stay up-to-date
with their field. A state-of-the-art text mining method (FASTREAD) supports SE
researchers in selecting literature of their interests (this approach uses an
active learner to suggest what small number of papers, out of many thousands of
candidates, might be worth reading).
While FASTREAD allows researchers to skim 90% fewer papers in fresh new
literature reviews, we find two common scenarios where knowledge from old
literature reviews can further enhance new one: i.e. a) researchers updating
their old literature reviews; b) researchers initializing new literature
reviews on topics similar to those of an old review. This paper tested two
novel UPDATE and REUSE extensions to FASTREAD. While UPDATE was proved to be
quite straight-forward (just importing data from old review to bootstrap
FASTREAD), REUSE was much more complex and required additional architecture.
Overall, we find that UPDATE, or our augmented REUSE tactic, allows
researchers to skim an additional 20% to 50% fewer papers by applying old
knowledge in the corresponding scenarios. Hence, we strongly recommend sharing
and applying old knowledge for new literature reviews.

a set of visualizations are devised to represent the semantic information in

examinations for screening and diagnosis of many lung diseases. A tremendous
number of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are
accumulated and stored in many modern hospitals' Picture Archiving and

how this type of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable imaging
informatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry
deep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision

with the text-mined eight disease image labels (where each image can have
multi-labels), from the associated radiological reports using natural language
processing. Importantly, we demonstrate that these commonly occurring thoracic
diseases can be detected and even spatially-located via a unified
weakly-supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization
framework, which is validated using our proposed dataset. Although the initial
quantitative results are promising as reported, deep convolutional neural

9,"The proliferation of malwares have been attributed to the alternations of a
handful of original malware source codes. The malwares alternated from the same
origin share some intrinsic behaviors and form a malware family. Expediently,
identifying its malware family when a malware is first seen on the Internet can
provide useful clues to mitigate the threat. In this paper, a malware profiler
(VMP) is proposed to profile the execution behaviors of a malware by leveraging
virtual machine introspection (VMI) technique. The VMP inserts plug-ins inside
the virtual machine monitor (VMM) to record the invoked API calls with their
input parameters and return values as the profile of malware. In this paper, a
popular similarity measurement Jaccard distance and a phylogenetic tree
construction method are adopted to discover malware families. The studies of
malware profiles show the malwares from a malware family are very similar to
each others and distinct from other malware families as well as benign
software. This paper also examines VMP against existing anti-malware detection
engines and some well-known malware grouping methods to compare the goodness in
their malware family constructions. A peer voting approach is proposed and the
results show VMP is better than almost all of the compared anti-malware
engines, and compatible with the fine tuned text-mining approach and high order

relevant quality attributes and application domains and assesses the quality of
each study. Method: We perform a systematic literature review underpinned by a
rigorously established and reviewed protocol. To ensure the quality of the
study, we choose 21 highly regarded publication venues and 8 popular digital

corpora has been an active theme in text mining and NLP research. Previous
studies adopt a dependency parsing-based pattern discovery approach. However,
the parsing results lose rich context around entities in the patterns, and the
process is costly for a corpus of large scale. In this study, we propose a
novel typed textual pattern structure, called meta pattern, which is extended
to a frequent, informative, and precise subsequence pattern in certain context.
We propose an efficient framework, called MetaPAD, which discovers meta
patterns from massive corpora with three techniques: (1) it develops a
context-aware segmentation method to carefully determine the boundaries of
patterns with a learnt pattern quality assessment function, which avoids costly
dependency parsing and generates high-quality patterns; (2) it identifies and
groups synonymous meta patterns from multiple facets---their types, contexts,
and extractions; and (3) it examines type distributions of entities in the
instances extracted by each group of patterns, and looks for appropriate type
levels to make discovered patterns precise. Experiments demonstrate that our
proposed framework discovers high-quality typed textual patterns efficiently
from different genres of massive corpora and facilitates information
extraction.

19,"Entity extraction is fundamental to many text mining tasks such as
organisation name recognition. A popular approach to entity extraction is based
on matching sub-string candidates in a document against a dictionary of
entities. To handle spelling errors and name variations of entities, usually
the matching is approximate and edit or Jaccard distance is used to measure
dissimilarity between sub-string candidates and the entities. For approximate
entity extraction from free text, existing work considers solely
character-based or solely token-based similarity and hence cannot
simultaneously deal with minor variations at token level and typos. In this
paper, we address this problem by considering both character-based similarity
and token-based similarity (i.e. two-level similarity). Measuring one-level
(e.g. character-based) similarity is computationally expensive, and measuring
two-level similarity is dramatically more expensive. By exploiting the
properties of the two-level similarity and the weights of tokens, we develop
novel techniques to significantly reduce the number of sub-string candidates
that require computation of two-level similarity against the dictionary of
entities. A comprehensive experimental study on real world datasets show that
our algorithm can efficiently extract entities from documents and produce a
high F1 score in the range of [0.91, 0.97].

due to low concept overlap. In this paper we propose two neural embedding
models in order to learn continuous concept vectors. Once learned, we propose
an efficient vector aggregation method to generate fully dense bag-of-concepts
representations. Empirical results on a benchmark dataset for measuring entity
semantic relatedness show superior performance over other concept embedding

demonstrate the effectiveness of the densified vector representation over the

space, however, the ""curse of dimensionality"" associated with high feature
dimensions is particularly severe for the Euclidean distance. This paper

high-dimensional angular momentum eigenmodes. Being a natural measure of
similarity between sample points dwelling on a hypersphere, the exact kernel
often shows superior performance in kernel SVM classifications applied to text

applications such as text mining, signal processing, bioinformatics, and so on.
However, the computational cost can be a problem when we repeat many distance
calculations as seen in real-life searching situations. A promising solution to
cope with the problem is to approximate the edit distance by another distance
with a lower computational cost. There are, indeed, many distances have been
proposed for approximating the edit distance. However, their approximation
accuracies are evaluated only theoretically: many of them are evaluated only
with big-oh (asymptotic) notations, and without experimental analysis.
Therefore, it is beneficial to know their actual performance in real
applications. In this study we compared existing six approximation distances in
two approaches: (i) we refined their theoretical approximation accuracy by
calculating up to the constant coefficients, and (ii) we conducted some
experiments, in one artificial and two real-life data sets, to reveal under
which situations they perform best. As a result we obtained the following
results: [Batu 2006] is the best theoretically and [Andoni 2010]

for informing public health policy or monitoring risk behavior. This paper
presents a text-mining method for conducting public health surveillance of
marijuana use concerns in the U.S. using online classified ads in Craigslist.
We collected more than 200 thousands of rental ads in the housing categories in
Craigslist and devised text-mining methods for efficiently and accurately
extract rental ads associated with concerns about the uses of marijuana in
different states across the U.S. We linked the extracted ads to their
geographic locations and computed summary statistics of the ads having
marijuana use concerns. Our data is then compared with the State Marijuana Laws
Map published by the U.S. government and marijuana related keywords search in
Google to verify our collected data with respect to the demographics of
marijuana use concerns. Our data not only indicates strong correlations between
Craigslist ads, Google search and the State Marijuana Laws Map in states where
marijuana uses are legal, but also reveals some hidden world of marijuana use
concerns in other states where marijuana use is illegal. Our approach can be
utilized as a marijuana surveillance tool for policy makers to develop public

of the biomedical knowledge on HIV/AIDS. A search of papers with the
identifiers ""HIV/AIDS"", ""Human Immunodeficiency Virus"", ""HIV-1"" and ""Acquired

out. A citation network of those papers was constructed. Then, a sub-network of
the papers with the highest number of inter-citations (with a minimal in-degree

Thirteen research fronts were identified in this sub-network. The biggest and
oldest front is related to the clinical knowledge on the disease in the
patient. Nine of the fronts are related to the study of specific molecular
structures and mechanisms and two of these fronts are related to the
development of drugs. The rest of the fronts are related to the study of the
disease at the cellular level. Interestingly, the emergence of these fronts
occurred in successive ""waves"" over the time which suggest a transition in the
paradigmatic focus. The emergence and evolution of the biomedical fronts in
HIV/AIDS research is explained not just by the partition of the problem in

dramatic changes in the epidemiological reality of HIV/AIDS that occurred

32,"Document similarity is the problem of formally representing textual documents
and then proposing a similarity measure that can be used to compute the
linguistic similarity between two documents. Accurate document similarity
computation improves many enterprise relevant tasks such as document
clustering, text mining, and question-answering. Most contemporary techniques
employ bag-of-words (BoW) based document representation models. In this paper,
we show that a document's thematic flow, which is often disregarded by
bag-of-word techniques, is pivotal in estimating their semantic similarity. In
this direction, we propose a novel semantic document similarity framework,
called SimDoc. We model documents as topic-sequences, where topics represent
latent generative clusters of relative words. We then use a sequence alignment
algorithm, that has been adapted from the Smith-Waterman gene-sequencing
algorithm, to estimate their semantic similarity. For similarity computation at
a finer granularity, we tune the alignment algorithm by integrating it with a
word embedding matrix based topic-to-topic similarity measure. A document level
similarity score is then computed by again using the sequence alignment
algorithm over all sentence pairs. In our experiments, we see that SimDoc
outperforms many contemporary bag-of-words techniques in accurately computing
document similarity, and on practical applications such as document clustering.

37,"One essential task in information extraction from the medical corpus is drug
name recognition. Compared with text sources come from other domains, the
medical text is special and has unique characteristics. In addition, the
medical text mining poses more challenges, e.g., more unstructured text, the
fast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same
drug. The mining is even more challenging due to the lack of labeled dataset
sources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a
single drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although
many approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems
remained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75). This paper presents a
new treatment in data representation techniques to overcome some of those
challenges. We propose three data representation techniques based on the
characteristics of word distribution and word similarities as a result of word
embedding training. The first technique is evaluated with the standard NN
model, i.e., MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptrons). The second technique involves two
deep network classifiers, i.e., DBN (Deep Belief Networks), and SAE (Stacked
Denoising Encoders). The third technique represents the sentence as a sequence
that is evaluated with a recurrent NN model, i.e., LSTM (Long Short Term
Memory). In extracting the drug name entities, the third technique gives the
best F-score performance compared to the state of the art, with its average
F-score being 0.8645.

38,"Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is the problem of determining two
non-negative low rank factors $W$ and $H$, for the given input matrix $A$, such
that $A \approx W H$. NMF is a useful tool for many applications in different
domains such as topic modeling in text mining, background separation in video
analysis, and community detection in social networks. Despite its popularity in
the data mining community, there is a lack of efficient parallel algorithms to
solve the problem for big data sets.
The main contribution of this work is a new, high-performance parallel
computational framework for a broad class of NMF algorithms that iteratively
solves alternating non-negative least squares (NLS) subproblems for $W$ and
$H$. It maintains the data and factor matrices in memory (distributed across
processors), uses MPI for interprocessor communication, and, in the dense case,
provably minimizes communication costs (under mild assumptions). The framework
is flexible and able to leverage a variety of NMF and NLS algorithms, including
Multiplicative Update, Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares, and Block
Principal Pivoting. Our implementation allows us to benchmark and compare
different algorithms on massive dense and sparse data matrices of size that
spans for few hundreds of millions to billions. We demonstrate the scalability
of our algorithm and compare it with baseline implementations, showing
significant performance improvements. The code and the datasets used for
conducting the experiments are available online.

textual data. A widely used topic modeler is Latent Dirichlet allocation. When
run on different datasets, LDA suffers from ""order effects"" i.e. different
topics are generated if the order of training data is shuffled. Such order
effects introduce a systematic error for any study. This error can relate to
misleading results;specifically, inaccurate topic descriptions and a reduction
in the efficacy of text mining classification results. Objective: To provide a
method in which distributions generated by LDA are more stable and can be used
for further analysis. Method: We use LDADE, a search-based software engineering
tool that tunes LDA's parameters using DE (Differential Evolution). LDADE is
evaluated on data from a programmer information exchange site (Stackoverflow),
title and abstract text of thousands ofSoftware Engineering (SE) papers, and
software defect reports from NASA. Results were collected across different
implementations of LDA (Python+Scikit-Learn, Scala+Spark); across different
platforms (Linux, Macintosh) and for different kinds of LDAs (VEM,or using
Gibbs sampling). Results were scored via topic stability and text mining
classification accuracy. Results: In all treatments: (i) standard LDA exhibits
very large topic instability; (ii) LDADE's tunings dramatically reduce cluster
instability; (iii) LDADE also leads to improved performances for supervised as
well as unsupervised learning. Conclusion: Due to topic instability, using
standard LDA with its ""off-the-shelf"" settings should now be depreciated. Also,
in future, we should require SE papers that use LDA to test and (if needed)
mitigate LDA topic instability. Finally, LDADE is a candidate technology for
effectively and efficiently reducing that instability.

43,"The ubiquitous presence of sequence data across fields such as the web,
healthcare, bioinformatics, and text mining has made sequence mining a vital
research area. However, sequence mining is particularly challenging because of
difficulty in finding (dis)similarity/distance between sequences. This is
because a distance measure between sequences is not obvious due to their
unstructuredness---arbitrary strings of arbitrary length. Feature
representations, such as n-grams, are often used but they either compromise on
extracting both short- and long-term sequence patterns or have a high
computation. We propose a new function, Sequence Graph Transform (SGT), that
extracts the short- and long-term sequence features and embeds them in a
finite-dimensional feature space. Importantly, SGT has low computation and can
extract any amount of short- to long-term patterns without any increase in the
computation, also proved theoretically in this paper. Due to this, SGT yields
superior result with significantly higher accuracy and lower computation
compared to the existing methods. We show it via several experimentation and

structured components, is an active research topic in many areas, such as music

introduce the Positive $\alpha$-stable (P$\alpha$S) distributions to model the
latent sources, which are a subclass of the stable distributions family. They
notably permit us to model random variables that are both nonnegative and
impulsive. Considering the L\'evy distribution, the only P$\alpha$S
distribution whose density is tractable, we propose a mixture model called
L\'evy Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (L\'evy NMF). This model accounts for
low-rank structures in nonnegative data that possibly has high variability or
is corrupted by very adverse noise. The model parameters are estimated in a
maximum-likelihood sense. We also derive an estimator of the sources given the
parameters, which extends the validity of the generalized Wiener filtering to
the P$\alpha$S case. Experiments on synthetic data show that L\'evy NMF
compares favorably with state-of-the art techniques in terms of robustness to
impulsive noise. The analysis of two types of realistic signals is also

The results highlight the potential of the L\'evy NMF model for decomposing

have departed from the use of simple word count statistics towards a new
paradigm. Text mining now hinges on a more sophisticated set of methods,
including the representations in terms of complex networks. While
well-established word-adjacency (co-occurrence) methods successfully grasp
syntactical features of written texts, they are unable to represent important
aspects of textual data, such as its topical structure, i.e. the sequence of
subjects developing at a mesoscopic level along the text. Such aspects are
often overlooked by current methodologies. In order to grasp the mesoscopic
characteristics of semantical content in written texts, we devised a network
model which is able to analyze documents in a multi-scale fashion. In the
proposed model, a limited amount of adjacent paragraphs are represented as
nodes, which are connected whenever they share a minimum semantical content. To
illustrate the capabilities of our model, we present, as a case example, a
qualitative analysis of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". We show that the
mesoscopic structure of a document, modeled as a network, reveals many semantic
traits of texts. Such an approach paves the way to a myriad of semantic-based
applications. In addition, our approach is illustrated in a machine learning

problems in information retrieval. Stemming is a common approach to this end.
Among many techniques for stemming, statistical stemming has been shown to be
effective in a number of languages, particularly highly inflected languages. In
this paper we propose a method for finding affixes in different positions of a

of prefix and suffix matching. Since infixes are common in irregular/informal
inflections in morphologically complex texts, it is required to find infixes

collecting both brain activation coordinates and associated text across a large
cohort of neuroimaging research papers. One of the fundamental aspects of such
meta-analysis is text-mining. To date, word counts and more sophisticated
methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation have been proposed. In this work we
present an unsupervised study of the NeuroSynth text corpus using Deep
Boltzmann Machines (DBMs). The use of DBMs yields several advantages over the
aforementioned methods, principal among which is the fact that it yields both
word and document embeddings in a high-dimensional vector space. Such
embeddings serve to facilitate the use of traditional machine learning
techniques on the text corpus. The proposed DBM model is shown to learn
embeddings with a clear semantic structure.

Bayes, SVM which classify and cluster the text document for mining relevant
information about the documents. The need for improving the mining techniques

proposes one technique which uses the auxiliary information that is present

be a description to the content. This information can be either useful or
completely useless for mining. The user should assess the worth of the
auxiliary information before considering this technique for text mining. In
this paper, a combination of classical clustering algorithms is used to mine

different levels of abstraction. The clustered documents would then be
classified based on the necessary groups. The proposed technique is aimed at

technique for mining useful information from the web. We aim at discovering in

sentiment polarities, two forms of positive vs. negative opinions and 2)
driving actual content from the textual data that has a semantic trend. The

achieve the former goal, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular topic
modeling algorithm, is used for the latter purpose. This is the first study
which discover semantic properties of textual data in consumption context

psychological diseases such as burnout, which lead developers to lose interest,
exhibit lower activity and/or feel powerless. Prevention is essential for such
diseases, which in turn requires early identification of symptoms. The
emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal and Dominance (VAD) are able to derive
a person's interest (attraction), level of activation and perceived level of
control for a particular situation from textual communication, such as emails.
As an initial step towards identifying symptoms of productivity loss in
software engineering, this paper explores the VAD metrics and their properties
on 700,000 Jira issue reports containing over 2,000,000 comments, since issue
reports keep track of a developer's progress on addressing bugs or new
features. Using a general-purpose lexicon of 14,000 English words with known
VAD scores, our results show that issue reports of different type (e.g.,
Feature Request vs. Bug) have a fair variation of Valence, while increase in
issue priority (e.g., from Minor to Critical) typically increases Arousal.
Furthermore, we show that as an issue's resolution time increases, so does the
arousal of the individual the issue is assigned to. Finally, the resolution of
an issue increases valence, especially for the issue Reporter and for quickly
addressed issues. The existence of such relations between VAD and issue report
activities shows promise that text mining in the future could offer an
alternative way for work health assessment surveys.

form, insurmountable in scope for humans and incomprehensible in structure for
computers. Text mining is an expanding field of research that seeks to utilize
the information contained in vast document collections. General data mining
methods based on machine learning face challenges with the scale of text data,
posing a need for scalable text mining methods.
This thesis proposes a solution to scalable text mining: generative models
combined with sparse computation. A unifying formalization for generative text
models is defined, bringing together research traditions that have used
formally equivalent models, but ignored parallel developments. This framework
allows the use of methods developed in different processing tasks such as
retrieval and classification, yielding effective solutions across different
text mining tasks. Sparse computation using inverted indices is proposed for
inference on probabilistic models. This reduces the computational complexity of
the common text mining operations according to sparsity, yielding probabilistic
models with the scalability of modern search engines.
The proposed combination provides sparse generative models: a solution for
text mining that is general, effective, and scalable. Extensive experimentation
on text classification and ranked retrieval datasets are conducted, showing
that the proposed solution matches or outperforms the leading task-specific
methods in effectiveness, with a order of magnitude decrease in classification
times for Wikipedia article categorization with a million classes. The
developed methods were further applied in two 2014 Kaggle data mining prize

sense. In fact, each instance of each bag may have structural and/or temporal
relation with other instances in other bags. Thus, the classification task
should take into account the relation between semantically related instances
across bags. In this paper, we present two novel MIL approaches for sequence

represented by one vector of attributes. For each sequence of the unknown bag,
a discriminative classifier is applied in order to compute a partial

measure between each sequence of the unknown bag and the corresponding
sequences in the learning bags. An unknown bag is labeled with the bag that
presents more similar sequences. We applied both approaches to the problem of

in many real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an Infinite Author Topic
(IAT) model to resolve this issue. Instead of assigning a discrete probability
on fixed number of topics, we use a stochastic process to determine the number
of topics from the data itself. To be specific, we extend a gamma-negative
binomial process to three levels in order to capture the
author-document-keyword hierarchical structure. Furthermore, each document is
assigned a mixed gamma process that accounts for the multi-author's
contribution towards this document. An efficient Gibbs sampling inference
algorithm with each conditional distribution being closed-form is developed for
the IAT model. Experiments on several real-world datasets show the capabilities
of our IAT model to learn the hidden topics, authors' interests on these topics
and the number of topics simultaneously.

Quantification has several applications in data and text mining, such as
estimating the prevalence of positive reviews in a set of reviews of a given

the way in which documents will be represented in a vector space model, before

standard TWSs (e.g., Boolean and term-frequency schemes), the definition of
TWSs has been traditionally an art. Further, it is still a difficult task to
determine what is the best TWS for a particular problem and it is not clear
yet, whether better schemes, than those currently available, can be generated
by combining known TWS. We propose in this article a genetic program that aims
at learning effective TWSs that can improve the performance of current schemes
in text classification. The genetic program learns how to combine a set of
basic units to give rise to discriminative TWSs. We report an extensive
experimental study comprising data sets from thematic and non-thematic text
classification as well as from image classification. Our study shows the

105,"Rotationally symmetric distributions on the p-dimensional unit hypersphere,
extremely popular in directional statistics, involve a location parameter theta
that indicates the direction of the symmetry axis. The most classical way of
addressing the spherical location problem H_0:theta=theta_0, with theta_0 a
fixed location, is the so-called Watson test, which is based on the sample mean
of the observations. This test enjoys many desirable properties, but its
implementation requires the sample size n to be large compared to the dimension
p. This is a severe limitation, since more and more problems nowadays involve
high-dimensional directional data (e.g., in genetics or text mining). In this
work, we therefore introduce a modified Watson statistic that can cope with
high-dimensionality. We derive its asymptotic null distribution as both n and p
go to infinity. This is achieved in a universal asymptotic framework that
allows p to go to infinity arbitrarily fast (or slowly) as a function of n. We
further show that our results also provide high-dimensional tests for a problem
that has recently attracted much attention, namely that of testing that the
covariance matrix of a multinormal distribution has a ""theta_0-spiked""
structure. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation study corroborates our asymptotic
results.

in different languages is complementary, both regarding facts and opinions.
While Information Extraction and other text mining software can, in principle,
be developed for many languages, most text analysis tools have only been

is large. Self-training tools obviously alleviate the problem, but even the
effort of providing training data and of manually tuning the results is usually
considerable. In this paper, we gather insights by various multilingual system

measured value, the system either accepts or rejects the hypothesis from
statistical point of view. Moreover, even it does not find any direct
relationship among the entities of the hypothesis, it presents a network to
give an integral overview of all the entities through which the entities might
be related. This is also congenial for the researchers to widen their view and
thus think of new hypothesis for further investigation. It assists researcher
to get a quantitative evaluation of their assumptions such that they can reach

their respective m features. It was known that documents belonging to a
document type, say X, tend to have higher WF values for some particular
features. If the documents belonging to a cluster had higher WF values for

123,"A major computational burden, while performing document clustering, is the
calculation of similarity measure between a pair of documents. Similarity
measure is a function that assigns a real number between 0 and 1 to a pair of
documents, depending upon the degree of similarity between them. A value of
zero means that the documents are completely dissimilar whereas a value of one
indicates that the documents are practically identical. Traditionally,
vector-based models have been used for computing the document similarity. The
vector-based models represent several features present in documents. These
approaches to similarity measures, in general, cannot account for the semantics
of the document. Documents written in human languages contain contexts and the
words used to describe these contexts are generally semantically related.
Motivated by this fact, many researchers have proposed seman-tic-based
similarity measures by utilizing text annotation through external thesauruses
like WordNet (a lexical database). In this paper, we define a semantic
similarity measure based on documents represented in topic maps. Topic maps are
rapidly becoming an industrial standard for knowledge representation with a
focus for later search and extraction. The documents are transformed into a
topic map based coded knowledge and the similarity between a pair of documents
is represented as a correlation between the common patterns (sub-trees). The
experimental studies on the text mining datasets reveal that this new
similarity measure is more effective as compared to commonly used similarity
measures in text clustering.

are commonly represented through variants of sparse Bag of Words (sBoW) vectors
(e.g. TF-IDF). Although simple and intuitive, sBoW style representations suffer
from their inherent over-sparsity and fail to capture word-level synonymy and
polysemy. Especially when labeled data is limited (e.g. in document
classification), or the text documents are short (e.g. emails or abstracts),
many features are rarely observed within the training corpus. This leads to
overfitting and reduced generalization accuracy. In this paper we propose Dense
Cohort of Terms (dCoT), an unsupervised algorithm to learn improved sBoW
document features. dCoT explicitly models absent words by removing and
reconstructing random sub-sets of words in the unlabeled corpus. With this
approach, dCoT learns to reconstruct frequent words from co-occurring
infrequent words and maps the high dimensional sparse sBoW vectors into a
low-dimensional dense representation. We show that the feature removal can be
marginalized out and that the reconstruction can be solved for in closed-form.
We demonstrate empirically, on several benchmark datasets, that dCoT features
significantly improve the classification accuracy across several document

community, while having a good understanding of the type of people drawn or
currently using drugs is vital for finding effective intervening strategies.
Especially for the Russian Federation this is of immediate concern given the
dramatic increase it has seen in drug abuse since the fall of the Soviet Union
in the early nineties. Using unique data from the Russian social network
'LiveJournal' with over 39 million registered users worldwide, we were able for
the first time to identify the on-line drug community by context sensitive text
mining of the users' blogs using a dictionary of known drug-related official
and 'slang' terminology. By comparing the interests of the users that most
actively spread information on narcotics over the network with the interests of
the individuals outside the on-line drug community, we found that the 'average'
drug user in the Russian Federation is generally mostly interested in topics
such as Russian rock, non-traditional medicine, UFOs, Buddhism, yoga and the
occult. We identify three distinct scale-free sub-networks of users which can
be uniquely classified as being either 'infectious', 'susceptible' or 'immune'.

Several measures have been developed for measuring similarity between two
concepts: out of these we see that the measure given by Wu and Palmer [1] is
simple, and gives good performance. Our measure is based on their measure but
strengthens it. Wu and Palmer [1] measure has a disadvantage that it does not
consider how far the concepts are semantically. In our measure we include the
shortest path between the concepts and the depth of whole taxonomy together
with the distances used in Wu and Palmer [1]. Also the measure has following
disadvantage i.e. in some situations, the similarity of two elements of an IS-A
ontology contained in the neighborhood exceeds the similarity value of two
elements contained in the same hierarchy. Our measure introduces a penalization
factor for this case based upon shortest length between the concepts and depth
of whole taxonomy.

select the most relevant features or variables to improve the generalization
ability, or to provide a better interpretation of the prediction models. {In
this paper, a novel adaptive feature scaling (AFS) scheme is proposed by
introducing a feature scaling {vector $\d \in [0, 1]^m$} to alleviate the bias
problem brought by the scaling bias of the diverse features.} By reformulating
the resultant AFS model to semi-infinite programming problem, a novel feature
generating method is presented to identify the most relevant features for

methods, the new formulation has the advantage of solving extremely
high-dimensional and large-scale problems. With an exact solution to the
worst-case analysis in the identification of relevant features, the proposed
feature generating scheme converges globally. More importantly, the proposed
scheme facilitates the group selection with or without special structures.

135,"A major computational burden, while performing document clustering, is the
calculation of similarity measure between a pair of documents. Similarity
measure is a function that assign a real number between 0 and 1 to a pair of
documents, depending upon the degree of similarity between them. A value of
zero means that the documents are completely dissimilar whereas a value of one
indicates that the documents are practically identical. Traditionally,
vector-based models have been used for computing the document similarity. The
vector-based models represent several features present in documents. These
approaches to similarity measures, in general, cannot account for the semantics
of the document. Documents written in human languages contain contexts and the
words used to describe these contexts are generally semantically related.
Motivated by this fact, many researchers have proposed semantic-based
similarity measures by utilizing text annotation through external thesauruses
like WordNet (a lexical database). In this paper, we define a semantic
similarity measure based on documents represented in topic maps. Topic maps are
rapidly becoming an industrial standard for knowledge representation with a
focus for later search and extraction. The documents are transformed into a
topic map based coded knowledge and the similarity between a pair of documents
is represented as a correlation between the common patterns. The experimental
studies on the text mining datasets reveal that this new similarity measure is
more effective as compared to commonly used similarity measures in text
clustering.

available scanning devices and optical character recognition tools, has
necessitated efficient storage, retrieval and management of massive text

INSTRUCT efficiently handles prefix and suffix search queries in addition to

search efficiently, albeit with an increase in the space requirements. This
extension is important in the context of trie-based solutions which are unable
to handle such queries efficiently. We perform several experiments portraying
that INSTRUCT outperforms the existing structures by nearly a factor of two in
terms of space requirements, while the query times are better. The ability to
handle insertion and deletion of strings in addition to supporting all kinds of

INSTRUCT a complete data structure.

138,"As one of the simplest probabilistic topic modeling techniques, latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA) has found many important applications in text
mining, computer vision and computational biology. Recent training algorithms
for LDA can be interpreted within a unified message passing framework. However,
message passing requires storing previous messages with a large amount of
memory space, increasing linearly with the number of documents or the number of
topics. Therefore, the high memory usage is often a major problem for topic
modeling of massive corpora containing a large number of topics. To reduce the
space complexity, we propose a novel algorithm without storing previous
messages for training LDA: tiny belief propagation (TBP). The basic idea of TBP
relates the message passing algorithms with the non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) algorithms, which absorb the message updating into the
message passing process, and thus avoid storing previous messages. Experimental
results on four large data sets confirm that TBP performs comparably well or
even better than current state-of-the-art training algorithms for LDA but with
a much less memory consumption. TBP can do topic modeling when massive corpora
cannot fit in the computer memory, for example, extracting thematic topics from

this problem real time search engines have recently received increased

158,"Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) have emerged as a powerful framework that
combines statistical and logical reasoning; they have been applied to many data
intensive problems including information extraction, entity resolution, and
text mining. Current implementations of MLNs do not scale to large real-world
data sets, which is preventing their wide-spread adoption. We present Tuffy
that achieves scalability via three novel contributions: (1) a bottom-up
approach to grounding that allows us to leverage the full power of the
relational optimizer, (2) a novel hybrid architecture that allows us to perform
AI-style local search efficiently using an RDBMS, and (3) a theoretical insight
that shows when one can (exponentially) improve the efficiency of stochastic
local search. We leverage (3) to build novel partitioning, loading, and
parallel algorithms. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
implementations in both quality and speed on several publicly available

used is a process to derive high-quality information from text. Perl Status
Reporter (SRr) is a data fetching tool from a flat text file and in this
research paper we illustrate the use of SRr in text or data mining. SRr needs a
flat text input file where the mining process to be performed. SRr reads input
file and derives the high quality information from it. Typically text mining
tasks are text categorization, text clustering, concept and entity extraction,
and document summarization. SRr can be utilized for any of these tasks with
little or none customizing efforts. In our implementation we perform text
categorization mining operation on input file. The input file has two
parameters of interest (firstKey and secondKey). The composition of these two
parameters describes the uniqueness of entries in that file in the similar
manner as done by composite key in database. SRr reads the input file line by
line and extracts the parameters of interest and form a composite key by
joining them together. It subsequently generates an output file consisting of
the name as firstKey secondKey. SRr reads the input file and tracks the
composite key. It further stores all that data lines, having the same composite
key, in output file generated by SRr based on that composite key.

applications. However, most existing metric learning algorithms are limited to
learning metrics over low-dimensional data, while existing kernel learning
algorithms are often limited to the transductive setting and do not generalize
to new data points. In this paper, we study metric learning as a problem of
learning a linear transformation of the input data. We show that for
high-dimensional data, a particular framework for learning a linear
transformation of the data based on the LogDet divergence can be efficiently
kernelized to learn a metric (or equivalently, a kernel function) over an
arbitrarily high dimensional space. We further demonstrate that a wide class of
convex loss functions for learning linear transformations can similarly be
kernelized, thereby considerably expanding the potential applications of metric

engineering practices. In particular, OSS projects are managed by a large
number of volunteers, working freely on the tasks they choose to undertake. OSS
projects also rarely rely on explicit system-level design, or on project plans

collaborate almost exclusively over the Internet, using simple tools such as
email and software code tracking databases (e.g. CVS). All the characteristics
above make OSS development akin to weaving a tapestry of heterogeneous
components. The OSS design process relies on various types of actors: people
with prescribed roles, but also elements coming from a variety of information
spaces (such as email and software code). The objective of our research is to
understand the specific hybrid weaving accomplished by the actors of this

methodologies used to understand distributed software engineering: OSS
development is simply too ""fibrous"" to lend itself well to analysis under a

of a project's hybrid network. We combine ethnography, text mining, and
